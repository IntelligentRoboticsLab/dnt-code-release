To ensure full control over robot-to-robot and robot-to-gamecontroller communication, the Dutch Nao Team has developed `bifrost`: a specialized messaging protocol for robot soccer communication. It provides us with fine-grained control over data encoding, decoding, transmission, and reception, while enabling effortless creation of new packet types, ensuring flexible and dynamic management of robot-to-robot communication.
